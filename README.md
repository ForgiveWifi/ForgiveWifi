Hello, my name is JT Sgro!  I'm very interested in cryptocurrency, and Plutus development. Looking to develop on Cardano network and create useful and meaningful applications in the Cardano ecosystem. My goal is to continue learning Haskell and build my knowledge to a point where I can be a proficient developer and work in the blockchain industry.
